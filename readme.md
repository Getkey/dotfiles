# Dotfiles

My dotfiles.

# Install
```sh
./bootstrap.sh
```
You should run this command at least every time a new file is commited.

If there are conflicts between my dotfiles and yours the script will ask you what to do.
It won't link files that contain my name unless your username is `getkey` or `mourerj`.
